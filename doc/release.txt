How to make a release

- decide the new version name:
	VERSION=1.7.6

- increase the release number in source/source/mod.h: mod_version[]
	git commit -m "Version $VERSION" source/source/mod.h

- tag the version
	git tag $VERSION

- push the tag and version change to upstream:
	git push

- build the fw
	cd source/build
	make clean
	rm fs-i6_updater*bin fs-i6-swe_updater*bin
	make all
	make clean
	make all-swe
	cd ../..

- verify that we have the newest updater from
	https://github.com/mhils/flysky-updater/releases

- put the firmware files and updater to the release directory
	(do we want the archive to contain the top-level directory as well?

	mkdir FlyPlus-$VERSION
	cp source/build/fs-i6_updater_*.bin FlyPlus-$VERSION/
	cp source/build/fs-i6-swe_updater_*.bin FlyPlus-$VERSION/
	cp ../flysky-updater-linux64 ../flysky-updater-win64.exe FlyPlus-$VERSION/
	zip -r FlyPlus-$VERSION.zip FlyPlus-$VERSION/

- the source code release is made automatically by github as soon as you
	publish the release

- describe the release, using
	git log $PREVIOUS_RELEASE..

- add the possible caveats to wiki/Install.md as well
